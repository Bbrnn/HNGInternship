Dear Data Analysis Interns,
Stage Zero Task: Analyzing a Dataset and Writing a “First Glance” Technical Report Article
As part of your data analysis internship, you will be provided with a dataset to review. Your task is to examine the dataset, identify initial insights at first glance, and write a brief technical report detailing your observations. This exercise will help you develop skills in quickly interpreting data and communicating your findings.
Dataset Options:
Titanic Passenger List
Link: Titanic Dataset on Kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data>
Iris Flower Dataset
Link: Iris Dataset on UCI Machine Learning Repository <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris>
Retail Sales Data

Objectives
Review any of the provided dataset.
Identify initial insights from the data at first glance.
Write a brief technical report detailing your observations.
Steps to Complete the Task
Dataset Familiarization:
Open one of the provided dataset to understand its structure and contents.
Identify the key variables and data types (e.g., numerical, categorical).
Initial Data Exploration:
Conduct a quick review of the dataset without deep analysis.
Look for obvious patterns, trends, or anomalies in the data.
Insight Identification:
Note any initial insights that can be immediately observed from the dataset.
Technical Report Writing:
Write a brief technical report that includes:
Introduction: Briefly describe the dataset and the purpose of the review.
Observations: Present the initial insights you identified, supported by basic visualizations or summary statistics if necessary.
Conclusion: Summarize your observations and suggest potential areas for further analysis.
Review and Submission:
Proofread and edit your technical report for clarity and accuracy.
Publish your article on any online blog platform.
Submit the final technical report article link for review.

Acceptance Criteria
Data Review:
Conduct a quick review of the dataset to identify initial insights.
Present at least three initial observations from the data.
Technical Report:
The report should be well-structured, including an introduction, observations, and conclusion.
It MUST include at least two links to the HNG Internship websites; choose from any of https://hng.tech/internship, https://hng.tech/hire, or https://hng.tech/premium so others can learn more about the program.
Include at least one basic visualization (e.g., a simple chart or graph) to support your observations if necessary.
The report should be concise, around 400 words long.
Submit the report by 11:59PM Saturday.
